### Miscellaneous Info

* With node installed, `npm install -g http-server`
* Also install bower, `npm install -g bower` and then run `bower install riot`
* Fire up the server with `http-server` in the command line
* Use the riot CLI, which comes installed with Riot when you run `npm install -g riot`, to compile your tags in command line. To compile: ```riot ./path/to/your-tag-file.tag```
* Compile all your tags into one file: ```riot ./source/path/ ./output/path/file-name.js```
* Have riot watch for changes in your tag files by adding `-w` flag: ```riot -w ./source/path/ ./output/path/file-name.js```
